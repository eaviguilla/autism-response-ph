                    Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) a spectrum condition, is complex lifelong neuro-developmental disability that usually appears and can be observed when a person is in early stage of childhood. A person with autism have challenges in having an
                    impact on his/her social skills, speech, repetitive behavior (and will affect his/her when changing routine/s), nonverbal communication and other certain set of behaviors that defines a person with autism in varying degrees.

                <p style="text-align: center;center;padding: 3%;">Remember that each person is different, and specific tips may not apply to all. </p>
                <li> Many capable individuals on the autism spectrum have significant organizational difficulties. For example, these individuals will often complete their homework but forget to turn it in. Expecting organizational skills to simply improve
                    over time will not be as effective as putting support strategies in place, such as written checklists and reminders, while providing direct guidance and instruction. Eventually, the person can be taught to generate their own checklists
                    and reminders.</li>
                <li> Teach your child/students how to advocate for their own needs. This skill will become essential as they transition from school to the adult world. It could be as simple as teaching them to request their favorite food by handing you a picture,
                    or for someone with more verbal skills to explain their communication and accommodation needs to their college professor</li>
                <li> For parents/caregivers: Keep a record of treatment options and medications you try and how your child responds to each one.</li>
                <li> Remember that, particularly for persons who do not communicate verbally, their behavior is a form of communication. Try to determine the pattern of behavior. Examine what happened before to trigger the behavior and what happened after
                    as a result of the behavior. If you are stumped, ask other parents and professionals what might be the underlying cause(s) of behaviors.</li>
                <li>Know that just because your child/student may be nonverbal, he or she is still able to hear and understand what you and others say around them. Make sure all messages are as positive as possible.</li>
                <li>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder often lack perspective-taking skills. When watching a movie or looking at pictures of people, practice these skills by asking them questions about how the person is feeling, what they are thinking,
                    and what they are going to do next. Have them explain and point out the specific cues that support their ideas</li>
                <li> It is important to teach individuals on the autism spectrum how to think socially and interact successfully with others. As with all people, this should begin as early as possible. Help individuals on the autism spectrum establish connections
                    with others by developing appropriate social scripts and routines, and by supporting them to interact with others on a daily basis. This will assist social and emotional development which is critical for all people.</li>
                <li> Breaks and calming strategies should be considered as part of the daily routine for many individuals on the autism spectrum. A pre-determined routine should be implemented on a daily basis to ease anxiety. Breaks and calming techniques
                    are needed before an individual on the autism spectrum gets overwhelmed. Providing breaks and calming techniques only after a problem behavior occurs may inadvertently reinforce the behavior. By using a respectful and proactive approach,
                    the individual will build self-esteem and confidence, and reduce anxiety.</li>
                <li>Be aware of potential sensory issues in the individual’s environment. Consider the visual input (e.g. fluorescent or bright lights), auditory input (e.g. loud noises), tactile input (e.g. certain surfaces, textures, fabrics), and smell/tastes
                    (strong perfumes or certain food textures) that may be bothering the individual with autism spectrum disorder.</li>
                <li> Help your child with self-help activities such as getting dressed, eating breakfast, and brushing teeth. Create routines by doing these activities at the same time and in the same way every day. Break down the task into small steps. Show
                    pictures of each step. You can also pretend to do the activity yourself, saying the next step out loud or even singing songs with directions. Make it fun.</li>
                <li> Help your child play with others. Teach them to share and to take turns through use of visuals, modeling, prompting, and practice. Host a play date at your house. By playing at your house, your child has more control over the activities.
                    You can also control the amount and type of stimulation. When your child shares and takes turns appropriately, praise and reinforce his or her great behavior.
                </li>
                <li> When trying to foster friendships for teens or adults with ASD, connecting them with people who have similar interests (e.g., attending a Japanese Anime conference or enrolling in a chess club) is likely to be more effective than attempting
                    to teach them to interact around interests that seem more typical for their age group, such as team sports.
                </li>
                <li> In addition to changes in schedules, unstructured activities and wait time may also create anxiety and confusion for some individuals on the spectrum. Individuals may need specific directions and checklists of what to do during unstructured
                    activities. During long wait times (e.g. waiting for the school bus to arrive), a box of wait time activities, such as books, toys, or sensory items can be helpful.</li>
                <li>Individuals on the spectrum will read our emotional level about a situation. Use a calm tone of voice, even in the midst of a behavioral outburst. Excited adults yield excited children. Practice your poker face.</li>
                <li> Sleep issues is a problem for many individuals on the autism spectrum. Children and adolescents should keep a consistent bedtime routine, have a regular sleep/wake schedule, and avoid caffeine and screen time before bed.
                </li>
                <li> Acknowledge and celebrate the accomplishments of yourself (regardless of your role), of all family members, and of the individual whether they are small or large. For some on the autism spectrum, small steps are a major accomplishment.
                    Be proud and remember that all accomplishments are important. In addition, family members do not forget to acknowledge the accomplishments of your other children and spouse or partner whether large or small.</li>
